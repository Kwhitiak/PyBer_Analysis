# PyBer_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to explore the ridshare data from PyBer to see how each to see how the data differs by city type. This will be used to make any decisions in services and affordibility in undeserved areas.

## Analysis Challenge 


The Summary data of PyBer's dataset provides an overview of the camparisions between three different City types, Urban, Suburban and Rural.  The analysis of this summary Data frame shows an overwhelming amount of evidence that there is a significant amount of demand for ridesahes in Urban city types compared to Rural and Suburban.  Urban city types are making up about 68.4% of total rides by city type, at 1,625 between January 2019 and May 2019(PyBer Summary DF).  The below Pie Chart outlines the total percentages of each city type.

Conversely, the data also shows a larger percenage of total drivers in Urban city types when compared to Suburban and Rural city types.  There were 2,405 drivers in urban cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities, and 78 drivers in rural cities.
The below Pie charts shows the makeup of total drivers by City Type.

Also, taking a look at the total percent of fares from this time preiod, Urban cities also produced higher results when compared to Suburban and rural cities.  Urban cities made up 62.7% of the total fares from Jan through May and borught in nearly $40,000 worth of revenue(PyBer Summary DF).  Please see below Pie Chart for reference.

The below image furthur depcits the spread of Fars between city types.  Urban, the orange cirlce, takes up most of the plot chart since there are typically more Urban rides that cost more money due to demand.

## Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Based on our above analysis, it can be concluded that Urban City types will see more Rideshares due to higher demand from the greater population.  One recommendation we can make would be to try and get more drivers on the road to assist with the demand in Urban settings.  Increasing pricing in Urban cities would allow a reducation of pricing in Rural and Suburban areas to atract more business in these undeserved areas.  We could also allow higher compensation to divers in Rural and Suburban areas to boost the amnount of drivers on the road.
